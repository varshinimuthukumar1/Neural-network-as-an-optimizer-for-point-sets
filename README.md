# Neural-network-as-an-optimizer-for-point-sets

This is an experiment to achieve resampling of point sets in 2D using a neural network.  The network is trained in an unsupervised way, with only the spectral characteristic curve.  The training set is initialized with random Gaussian data, and using a simple MLP the point set can be moved towards Poisson distribution.
